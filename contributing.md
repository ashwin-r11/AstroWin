# Contributing to AstroWin

Thank you for your interest in contributing to AstroWin! As the project is in a very early, conceptual stage, there are many ways to contribute, even if you don't write a single line of code.

## How to Contribute

At this stage, we are primarily looking for intellectual contributions to help solidify the foundations of the AstroWin language. Here are some of the areas where we need the most help:

*   **Theoretical Discussions:** Engage in discussions about the core metaphors. Are they consistent? Do they hold up under scrutiny? Can they be improved?
*   **Language Design:** Help us flesh out the syntax and semantics of AstroWin. How should developers interact with Galaxies, Planets, and Blackholes?
*   **AI-Cortex Architecture:** What are the best strategies for building an AI-enhanced runtime? What are the security implications, and how can we mitigate them?
*   **Proof-of-Concept Implementations:** Are you skilled in compiler design or building interpreters? We would love to see small-scale prototypes that explore different aspects of the AstroWin vision.
*   **Documentation and Community Building:** Help us refine our documentation, write articles, and spread the word about AstroWin to attract more contributors.

## Getting Started

1.  **Read the Whitepaper:** Familiarize yourself with the core concepts of AstroWin by reading the foundational document.
2.  **Join the Discussion:** (We will set up a Discord/Gitter/etc. for community discussion - for now, please use GitHub Issues to start a conversation).
3.  **Pick an Area of Interest:** Find a topic that excites you and start a discussion. We value all contributions that help move this project forward.
